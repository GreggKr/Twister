initial release, as well as add more out-of-the-box features.

    to the client

  - Ability to cache files such as 404 messages and domain tops/bottom in RAM
  - Added support for PUT requests
  - Added README
  - Improved ModuleManager stability
  - Added WARNING level logging
  - Deprecated ModuleManager.unloadModules(), but still works
  - Added ModuleManager.shutdownModules() to replace unloadModules()
  - Corrected a bunch of documentation
  - Improved the Domain class
  - Added getTop(), getBottom(), getProcessedTop(), getProcessedBottom(), and
    exists() to the Domain class
  - Fixed Twister.reloadConfigurations()

New fields added to twister.ini:
  - caching
      Default value: true
      Description:
        Sets whether Twister should cache files such as domain tops/bottoms and
        404 messages in RAM
  - caching-interval
      Default value: 600
      Description:
        If caching is true, this defines the interval in seconds when Twister
        refreshes cached files

How to use domain redirects files:
  Domain redirect files are useful for link shortening, as well as fixing links that are in a new location.
  To add a domain redirect file, simply create a file called "redirects.ini" inside the root of your desired
  domain directory.
  To add a redirect for a specific path, simply add the following line (replacing the uppercase text):
    PATH > REDIRECT_URL
  To make all requests to the desired domain redirect, add the following line (replacing the uppercase text):
    * > REDIRECT_URL
  Example:
    /redirect/ > http://www.example.com/
